Just beginning!
Looking into nothingness may lead us to look at everything with a different light in our eyes. Nothingness can be overwhelming or comforting. 
This may not make sense, but not everything that is present can make sense to us because we are limited and for us not everything is bound to make sense. 
Now, there must be a reason we are made to be like this, but again it does not make sense as to why so, why can't we make sense of everything?
Are we lacking something somewhere? Or are we not consious enough of the unconsious that we just ignore it?
We are surely missing some bigger picture, perhaps we have the tiny pieces but we are not able to put together the puzzle. 
Again WHY?
Why after some point there is no explanation, why can't our minds comprehend beyond, have we somehow limited ourselves or are we not advanced enough?
But then why do such questions arise in our minds? Maybe we have the answer somewhere here.
Again, how to find that?
